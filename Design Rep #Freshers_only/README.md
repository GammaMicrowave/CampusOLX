**OPEN TO ALL FRESHERS ONLY.**
NO need to claim this issue.
NO submission will be accepted after **5th Jan, 11:59 PM**.

Your **First Design repetition task** is based on copying the hero section of a website and learning. This is a 3**0 points** task.

The task needs to be done on **Figma**. Figma is free to use and doesn't need to download. It is very easy to learn and hardly takes 20 minutes to learn. If you are unclear on how to use it, check the tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&t=784s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&t=784s)

## Procedure:

1. I will be sharing 1 jpg image of the hero section of the home screen of a website. Your task is to copy the entire jpg as it is.
2. Firstly select the frame of a desktop, and start by making the wire frame.
3. Once the wire-frame is made, start copying the nav bar completely then move downward and copy the entire screen.
4. Do the task in a Figma file and provide its link (in a .txt file). Submit your txt files in the **SST 2- Copying Main Screens** folder only.
5. If **anyone other than freshers** is seen doing this task then **serious plag** will be imposed.
6. If you copy paste the screen fro someone else's repo then also **serious plag** will be imposed.

> ✨**PRO-TIP:** Resize the jpg to the size of your website frame, then after making each and every element by keeping it on the original jpg and see if the sizes are the same and spacing, and alignment is proper. This makes it super easy to copy screens.

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

Make sure that the design is **exactly the same** as that of the jpg. Only Accurate designs would be merged!! See to it that the spacing, sizes, and alignment are perfect and the Hero section looks like a hero section. Don’t make any add-ons from your side. **Copy the screen to perfection.**

> ✨**PRO-TIP:** You must search **Figma Mirror** on google and then select our frame on Figma and you will be able to see how your website would look on the screen. Take references of sizes and spacing from there.
