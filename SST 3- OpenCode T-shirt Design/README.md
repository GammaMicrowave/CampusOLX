## IMP Announcement

If a design is found to be **extraordinarily great**, then that merch will be declared as the **official merch of OpenCode’22**. And the designer of that merch will get his/her designed **merch for free** as a part of the OpenCode event. So, make sure you participate and try designing **the best merch possible** as you might get your own designed merch for free! Though this is valid only if the merch is amazingly great and is selected as the official merch, But it is not necessary that out of all the submission we find the best match. **So, all the decent designs will be merged and given 30 points each.** 

## Procedure:

1. Firstly you must browse through and carefully **research** t-shirt designs on the web.
2. You first have to make a graphic design that appropriately **describes OpenCode**. Use graphics related to github, use slogans, use catchy phrases.
3. Now using the **mockup** video link given above make a mockup for a t-shirt. Remember that the design has to be implemented only on a T-Shirt and not on a hoodie or something else.
4. Do the task in a Figma file and provide its link (in a .txt file). Submit your txt files in the **SST 3- OpenCode T-shirt Design** folder only.

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

Make sure that the T-shirt looks like a t-shirt, Remember that only a **T-shirt** has to be designed. The design must be **unique** and your own creativity **do not copy designs** from other t-shirts, though you can take references and ideas for sure. Make sure you place the **OpenCode Logo** on the t-shirt. Use your creativity at its best, and for that do intensive research on the web to get amazing ideas.

> ✨**PRO-TIP:** First make the entire design that you want to impose on the t-shirt and then impose it don't try pacing each and every element when they are made. First make all the elements and then place them.
