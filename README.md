# CampusOLX üõí
An Imperative Web Design Repository
</br>
</br> 
CampusOLX, as the name implies, is a local online marketplace specifically designed for students at IIIT-A to buy and sell second-hand items, such as furniture, electronics, and other household goods. By providing a platform for students to sell items they no longer need or use, CampusOLX can help students save money on living expenses and make it easier for them to find affordable products. It can also be a convenient way for students to sell items they no longer need, allowing them to declutter and make some extra money. The website provides the convenience of being able to buy and sell items directly with other students on campus may make it an appealing option for students at IIIT-A.
</br>
</br>
Hola @contributors, we invite you to design the Campus OLX website, to use your creativity and design skills to tailor this website from the very beginning, from thinking about the user flow to implementing the visual design you have got to do it all!
</br>
</br>
> Website design is an extremely crucial aspect as it determines the very first impression we make on our audience. It impacts how our audience perceives us and this impression can either get them to remain on our page or leave it.

## üìÉCommon Guidelines:

- The repository is divided into several tasks. **Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only.** NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific folders.
- The mentors will evaluate the submissions and assign points for each specific task¬†based on a variety of design-related factors, such as the use of design thinking, the uniqueness of the idea, the submission's visual attractiveness, etc.
- Since everyone should be awarded for their efforts, the participants who qualify for the **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)** as mentioned in the respective folders of the task will be awarded Full Pointsüéâ
- Since the goals of these tasks are learning design rather than only earning points, any plagiarism or attempt at it will be frowned upon and will result in disqualification from OpenCode. You can always ping us with questions, and we'll be pleased to answer them, but merely duplicating other people's ideas to finish the jobs will be strongly prohibited.
