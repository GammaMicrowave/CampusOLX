Your Second **Small Side Task** is based on copying the hero section of a website and learning. This is a **20 points** task.

CampusOLX, as the name implies, is a local online marketplace specifically designed for students at IIIT-A to buy and sell second-hand items, such as furniture, electronics, and other household goods. By providing a platform for students to sell items they no longer need or use, CampusOLX can help students save money on living expenses and make it easier for them to find affordable products. It can also be a convenient way for students to sell items they no longer need, allowing them to declutter and make some extra money. The website provides the convenience of being able to buy and sell items directly with other students on campus may make it an appealing option for students at IIIT-A.

The task needs to be done on **Figma**.

## Procedure:

1. I will be sharing 1 jpg image of the hero section of the home screen of a website. Your task is to copy the entire jpg as it is.
2. Firstly select the frame of a desktop, and start by making the wire frame.
3. Once the wire-frame is made, start copying the nav bar completely then move downward and copy the entire screen.
4. Do the task in a Figma file and provide its link (in a .txt file). Submit your txt files in the **SST 2- Copying Main Screens** folder only.

> ✨**PRO-TIP:** Resize the jpg to the size of your website frame, then after making each and every element by keeping it on the original jpg and see if the sizes are the same and spacing, and alignment is proper. This makes it super easy to copy screens.

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

Make sure that the design is **exactly the same** as that of the jpg. Only Accurate designs would be merged!! See to it that the spacing, sizes, and alignment are perfect and the Hero section looks like a hero section. Don’t make any add-ons from your side. **Simply copy the screen to perfection.**

> ✨**PRO-TIP:** You must search **Figma Mirror** on google and then select our frame on Figma and you would be able to see how your website would look on the screen. Take references of sizes and spacing from there.
